                <p class="text">
                    Here at Lisgar Collegiate Institute, we value the importance of technology in the 21st Century classroom. 
                    Devices such as Windows laptops, Chromebooks, and tablets have been made available for student use.
                    Unfortunately, there previously lacked an easy and clear-cut method to track usage/signout information.
                    This has often led to confusion and delay. Therefore, Lisgar TeCheckout has been created to help fulfill
                    this administrative role.

                <h2 class="subtitle" id="subtitle2">How was this website built?</h2>
                <p class="text">
                    This website was designed and coded over the course of five weeks by Michael Cong. 
                    Several languages were used during development: HTML and CSS for page content and layout;
                    PHP for linking the user input with the background MySQL database; 
                    and some Javascript to top it all off. The majority of the code was written in Visual Studio Code, 
                    and everything was tested thoroughly on two popular browsers - Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.
                </p>

            <div class="column">
                <h2 class="subtitle" id="subtitle3">How does one use this website?</h2>
                <p class="text">
                    There are four pages in total. "Home" is for laptop signout - 
                    After filling out a form, simply press the "Submit" button and the website will automatically 
                    process it. "Students" is where students can check laptop availability for a selected period. 
                    "Teachers" is a password-protected Control Panel which staff members can access in order to
                    view/modify the database. Lastly, "About This Website" would be the page you are reading 
                    right now.
