# Lisgar-TeCheckout
This website project was created for my ICS4U Independent Studies Unit.
Here at Lisgar Collegiate Institute, we value the importance of technology as a learning tool.
Accordingly, devices such as laptops and Chromebooks have been made available for student use.
Unfortunately, there previously lacked an easy and clear-cut method to track usage/signout information. 
This is something that has often led to confusion and delay. Therefore, Lisgar TeCheckout was created
to help fulfill this administrative role.

Prequisites

As this is a website, it does not have any real requirements. Any computer made post-2001 (Pentium 4/256MB RAM) 
should be able to run it just fine. However, as it is not currently hosted on the World Wide Web, one will have to 
figure out a way to host it themselves (Paid services, Linux servers etc.)

-----------------------
Installing

It is possible to use the website offline using an all-in-one server package called USBWebserver. 
In order to do so, one can simply:

1. Download FullPackage.rar from the repo
2. Extract it to a desired location using WinRar (or other equivalents)
3. Open usbwebserver.exe
4. Click on "Localhost"

Note that this will only work on Windows computers.
